You can use the 'run_all_in_parallel.sh' script to run all the other in parallel, although the output will be quite messy.
For this to work you need to use 'sudo apt update && sudo apt install parallel' to install the 'parallel' command or you can run them individualy.

I recommand using these on Linux.
